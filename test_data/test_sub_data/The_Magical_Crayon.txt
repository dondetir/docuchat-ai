Lily was a quiet girl who had a very loud imagination. Her world was filled with brave knights, talking animals, and castles that floated on clouds. The problem was, they all lived inside her head. On the outside, her life was very plain.

One rainy Saturday, her mom gave her a dusty wooden box. "This was your grandma's when she was a little girl," she said. Inside was a jumble of old art supplies. Tucked in a corner, beneath a dried-up tube of paint and a hardened paintbrush, was a single crayon. It was a waxy, unassuming shade of purple, with no paper wrapper and worn down to a nub.

That night, Lily decided to draw. She taped a big piece of paper to her bedroom wall. She drew her favorite thing to imagine: a dragon. He wasn't a scary dragon; he had a big, friendly smile, round, clumsy wings, and a tail that curled into a happy question mark. As she colored him in with the old purple crayon, it felt strangely warm in her hand.

"Lily, we don't draw on the walls," her dad said gently when he came to tuck her in. But he was tired, and Lily was already half-asleep, so he decided to leave the drawing for the morning.

As soon as Lily’s breathing settled into the soft rhythm of sleep, something magical happened. The purple crayon drawing on the wall began to shimmer. With a soft *pop*, the dragon peeled himself right off the paper. He was no longer flat; he was a fully-formed, three-dimensional dragon, sparkling with a soft, purple light.

He padded over to Lily’s bed on silent, waxy feet and gave her a gentle nudge with his snout. "Hello, Lily," he whispered. His voice sounded like rustling leaves and crackling embers. "My name is Doodle. Would you like to come and play?"

Lily’s eyes opened wide. She wasn’t scared, just amazed. She took Doodle’s offered claw and he led her to the wall. The paper she had taped up was no longer paper; it was a shimmering gateway into a world made entirely of her own drawings.

They stepped through. The lopsided trees she had drawn last week stood proudly, their leaves a mixture of every color she owned. A flock of bird-scribbles chirped a cheerful, crayon-scented song. In the distance, the blocky castle she’d designed for her stick-figure king and queen stood tall, its flags waving in a gentle breeze.

"This is wonderful!" Lily cried. Doodle puffed out his chest with pride and invited her to climb onto his back. They flew over a wide, winding river of blue crayon strokes and soared past the smiling, yellow sun she had drawn in the corner.

But as they flew, they saw trouble ahead. A big, angry-looking scribble-monster was rampaging through a field of flowers, smudging them out with its messy, chaotic lines. Lily remembered drawing the monster. She had been cross with her brother that day and had scribbled her frustration onto a page.

"He's going to ruin everything!" Lily said.

Doodle landed softly. Lily looked at the monster, who was now trying to smudge out a happy little house. She noticed he wasn't really angry, just… lonely. He was a messy scribble in a world of neat lines and happy colors.

Lily reached into her pajama pocket and her fingers closed around the magical purple crayon, which was glowing with a warm light. She knew what to do. She didn't run up and try to erase the monster. Instead, she started to draw in the air. She drew a smaller, sillier-looking scribble-friend, with three eyes and a wide, goofy grin. The purple light flowed from the crayon, and the new scribble-friend popped into existence.

The big scribble-monster stopped its rampage. It looked at the new creature, who gave it a happy wave. Slowly, the big monster’s angry scribbles softened into a smile. The two scribbles started to dance, leaving a trail of joyful, loopy patterns in their wake.

Just as the sun began to peek through Lily’s real window, Doodle flew her back to her bed. "It's almost morning," he whispered, and with a final, friendly wink, he flattened himself back onto the paper, becoming a simple drawing once more.

When Lily woke up, she wondered if it had all been a dream. But then she looked at the drawing on her wall. There, next to the big scribble-monster, was the new, happy friend she had drawn for him. Lily smiled. She wasn't just a quiet girl with a loud imagination anymore. She was an artist, a creator, and a friend to a magical purple dragon.
