In the grandest castle in all the land, there lived a knight named Sir Reginald. He was, by far, the bravest knight in the kingdom. He was also, by far, the tiniest.

Sir Reginald’s helmet was a silver thimble, polished to a brilliant shine. His shoulder pads were two sturdy acorn caps, and his chest plate was fashioned from the lid of a sardine tin. His sword was a sewing needle, sharpened to a very fine point. What he lacked in size, he made up for in courage.

Lately, a great mystery had befallen the castle. Every night, food was vanishing from the royal kitchen. A whole ham disappeared on Monday. A wheel of cheese went missing on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the Royal Baker’s prize-winning lemon meringue pie vanished without a trace. The King blamed an army of mice, but Sir Reginald suspected a much larger foe.

"I shall stand guard tonight!" he declared to the Royal Court, his voice a brave squeak. "I will catch this villain and bring him to justice!"

That night, Sir Reginald hid behind a large sack of flour in the castle pantry. It was dark and quiet, except for the *drip-drip-drip* of a leaky faucet and the pounding of his own tiny, brave heart. He clutched his needle-sword and waited.

Just after midnight, the kitchen door creaked open. A huge, purple shadow fell across the checkered floor. A creature the size of a cow tiptoed in. It had shimmering scales, two large wings, and a long, winding tail. It was a dragon!

The dragon wasn’t breathing fire. Instead, his tummy was rumbling with a thunderous *GRRRRUMMMBLE*. He sniffed the air, his large nostrils twitching, and his eyes landed on a freshly baked chocolate cake.

As the dragon reached for the cake, Sir Reginald leaped from his hiding spot. "Halt, you scaly fiend!" he cried, his voice echoing in the silent kitchen. "Unhand that dessert!"

The dragon, whose name was Ignatius, was so startled he jumped back, bumping his head on a hanging pot with a loud *CLANG*. He looked down and saw the tiny knight, standing bravely between him and the cake, his needle-sword pointed right at the dragon’s big toe.

But Ignatius didn’t look angry. He looked embarrassed. "Oh, I’m sorry," he mumbled, his voice much softer than Sir Reginald expected. "I didn’t know anyone was here. It’s just… I’m so hungry."

Sir Reginald faltered. This was not the fierce, terrifying beast he had imagined. "You’re the one who has been stealing all the food?" he asked.

Ignatius shuffled his large feet. "Yes. My cave is a bit damp and there aren’t many snacks in the woods. But your kitchen always smells so wonderful. I am especially sorry about the lemon meringue pie. It was delicious."

The tiny knight looked at the giant dragon. He could see that Ignatius wasn’t evil. He was just a young, growing dragon with a very big appetite. Sir Reginald’s brave heart was also a kind one.

"You cannot steal the King’s food," he said sternly. "But you do not have to go hungry." He led Ignatius to a large wooden bin at the back of the kitchen. "This is the leftovers bin. The cooks put bruised apples, stale bread, and cheese rinds in here. It’s all still perfectly good."

To a dragon, it was a feast. Ignatius’s eyes lit up. He munched happily on a slightly squashed apple. "Thank you, Sir Knight!" he said with his mouth full.

Sir Reginald had an idea. "Ignatius," he said, "if you promise to stop stealing food, you can have the leftovers every night. And in return, perhaps you could help out?"

The next morning, the head cook came into the kitchen to find the ovens were already lit. A gentle, perfectly controlled flame from Ignatius’s snout had them warm and ready for the morning’s baking. The cook was overjoyed.

Sir Reginald was celebrated as a hero throughout the castle. He hadn’t defeated the dragon with his sword, but with his kindness. He had proven that sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is not to fight, but to make a new friend—even if that friend is a very large, very hungry, cake-loving dragon.
