As twilight settled over the meadow, the fireflies began their nightly dance. They rose from the long grass in a great, glittering swarm, and all together, they began to blink. It was a beautiful, steady pulse of light against the dark velvet sky. *Blink… blink… blink…*

Well, almost all of them. 

In the middle of the swarm was a young firefly named Flicker. Flicker was enthusiastic and his light was very bright, but he simply could not get the rhythm right. While the others blinked in perfect time, Flicker’s light was all over the place. *Blink-blink… bliiink… blink…*

"Flicker, you’re ruining the show!" complained another firefly named Beacon, who was very proud of his own perfectly-timed blink. "You have to be in sync!"

Flicker tried his best, but his light just had a mind of its own. Feeling sad and clumsy, he flew away from the swarm and sat by himself on a long blade of grass, watching the others perform their beautiful, boring dance.

As he sat there, he heard a tiny, panicked squeaking coming from below. He looked down and saw a mother field mouse running frantically through the tall grass. "Pip? Pip, where are you?" she cried.

A tiny voice answered, "Mommy, I’m lost!"

The mother mouse ran towards the sound, but the grass was like a thick forest. She would run one way, and the voice would seem to come from another. She was going in circles, and it was getting darker and darker.

Flicker’s little light-bulb heart felt a surge of sympathy. He wanted to help, but he knew his single, blinking light wasn’t enough to light up the whole meadow. The other fireflies were too busy with their synchronized dance to notice the little drama unfolding below.

He looked at his own light, which gave a little *blink-blink* of excitement. He couldn’t blink like the others, but maybe he didn’t have to. He had an idea. A bright idea.

He flew high into the air, up above the maze of grass. He took a deep breath, concentrated with all his might, and then turned his light on and kept it on. He swooped down and then up, leaving a long, glowing trail of light in the air, like someone drawing with a sparkler. He drew a giant, shining arrow in the darkness, pointing right to the spot where he had seen the baby mouse, Pip, tumble over.

To make sure the mother mouse understood, he then drew a simple picture of a mouse with very big ears and a long tail. 

The mother mouse stopped running. She looked up and saw the glowing pictures in the sky. An arrow, and a picture of a mouse! She followed the arrow, pushing her way through the grass, and there, huddled by a dandelion, was her lost baby.

"Oh, Pip!" she cried, hugging him close. "How did you find me?" asked Pip. His mother pointed a grateful paw up at the sky. "A friendly star showed me the way."

Flicker’s drawing faded, but not before everyone else in the meadow had seen it. The dancing fireflies stopped their blinking. They had never seen anything like it. They flew over to Flicker, their lights flickering with curiosity.

"How did you do that?" asked Beacon, his voice full of awe.

"I just… drew what I wanted to say," Flicker explained, feeling a warm glow of pride.

The other fireflies were amazed. They realized that Flicker’s unique talent was far more special than their own boring blinking. "Can you teach us?" they all buzzed.

Flicker, who had felt like an outcast just a few minutes earlier, was now their teacher. He showed them how to keep their lights on and how to swoop and swirl to create pictures in the night. Soon, the sky was filled not with steady blinks, but with glowing flowers, sparkling stars, and funny faces.

Flicker became the forest’s first nighttime storyteller. His swarm became famous for creating the most incredible light shows the meadow had ever seen. And Flicker learned that being different wasn’t a problem at all. Sometimes, it’s the thing that allows you to be truly brilliant.
