Up in a big, fluffy, pillow-white cloud lived a tiny raindrop named Pip. He was perfectly round, perfectly clear, and perfectly terrified. 

It was time. The cloud was heavy, and the Earth below was thirsty. One by one, Pip’s brothers and sisters were letting go, falling with happy shouts to water the world. "Wheee!" cried one, landing on a daisy. "Geronimo!" yelled another, splashing into a birdbath.

Pip, however, clung to the edge of the cloud, his little water-body trembling. "I can’t!" he whispered. "It’s too high! It’s too far!"

Just then, a wise old gust of wind named Gus swirled by. Gus had traveled the entire world, from the highest mountains to the widest oceans, and he knew a thing or two about falling. He saw the scared little raindrop.

"What’s the matter, little one?" Gus rustled in a soft, gentle voice. 

"I’m afraid to fall," Pip quivered.

"Ah," said Gus. "But you see, falling isn’t an end. It’s the beginning of the most wonderful adventure. And you don’t have to do it alone. I’ll travel with you."

Before Pip could protest, Gus gave him a soft, encouraging nudge. Pip let go. He squeezed his non-existent eyes shut and braced for the long, scary drop. But instead of a terrifying plunge, he felt Gus the Wind swirl around him, turning the fall into a fun, spiraling slide.

He opened his eyes just in time to see his first stop: the bright red petal of a tulip. He landed with a soft *plink* and slid down the petal like it was a waterslide, right to the base of the flower, sinking into the soil to give the thirsty roots a drink. "Oh, thank you," he heard the tulip murmur.

From the tulip leaf, he dripped onto a busy ant trail. To the ants, he was suddenly a giant lake! He watched in amazement as the clever ants worked together, laying down a piece of a leaf to build a bridge so they could cross.

Soon, he was flowing again, trickling from the dirt into a small puddle. The puddle was filled with other raindrops, all chattering at once. "I landed on a cow’s nose!" said one. "I helped a spider finish her web!" said another. Pip had his own story to tell now.

The puddle soon overflowed, and the water trickled into a small, babbling brook. Pip felt himself moving faster, joining a huge family of water drops. They tumbled over smooth, grey stones and swirled past the legs of a deer that had stopped for a drink. The journey was getting bigger and more exciting with every moment.

The brook eventually joined a wide, flowing river. Now Pip was part of something truly grand. He saw silvery fish swimming below him and big, colorful boats floating high above. He traveled past green fields and bustling towns. Gus the Wind was always there, sometimes pushing him gently from behind, sometimes just whispering stories of the things they were seeing.

Finally, after a long and wonderful journey, Pip felt a change. The water tasted salty. The river was opening up into the great, wide, sparkling blue ocean. He was part of something so immense and beautiful it took his breath away. He bobbed on the surface, watching the gulls fly overhead.

He felt the warm sun on his surface. "What happens now, Gus?" he asked.

"Now comes the next adventure," Gus whispered. "The sun will warm you, and you’ll become a vapor, so light you’ll float all the way back up to a cloud."

Pip looked up at the sky. He could see a big, fluffy, pillow-white cloud forming. He wasn’t scared anymore. He was a world-traveler, an adventurer. He had watered a flower, blocked an ant-highway, and journeyed down a river to the sea. And he couldn’t wait to do it all over again.
