The Man in the Moon was known for two things: his big, friendly smile that he shared with the world every night, and his deep, peaceful sleep that he enjoyed every day. But lately, the Moon had not been sleeping well.

The problem was the clouds. A group of young, wispy clouds had discovered that the Moon’s large, craterous nose was extremely ticklish. All day long, while he was trying to sleep, they would drift by and give his nose a little *tickle-tickle-tickle* with their fluffy edges.

And every time they did, the Moon would let out a giant, sky-shaking sneeze. "Aaaaaah-CHOOOOOOOM!"

The sneeze would rattle the stars, make the planets wobble, and worst of all, it would wake up the bats who were trying to sleep in the forest below.

Pip was the smallest bat in his colony, but he had the biggest ears. He was a very good listener, and he could hear the grumbles of all the other creatures. The squirrels were grumpy, the owls were irritable, and the bears were absolutely furious about being woken up. Something had to be done.

That evening, as the Moon was rising, still looking tired and bleary-eyed, Pip flew right up to him. "Mr. Moon, sir?" he squeaked. "Is everything alright? Your sneezes are causing quite a stir."

The Moon sighed a gusty, cosmic sigh. "It’s these clouds, Pip! They won’t stop tickling my nose. I haven’t had a good day’s sleep in a week!"

Pip’s big ears twitched as he thought. He flew back down to his colony, gathered all the other bats, and explained the situation. "The Moon needs a blanket!" he declared. "A big blanket to cover his nose so the clouds can’t tickle it."

It was a brilliant idea. The bats immediately flew off to gather supplies. They went to the garden spiders, who, after hearing the story, kindly spun them spools of their strongest, stickiest silk. They flew to the meadows, where they gathered the softest, fluffiest dandelion seeds that were ready to float away. They flew to the ancient sycamore trees and collected the biggest, smoothest leaves.

All through the night, they worked. Under Pip’s direction, they wove the spider silk into a giant, sturdy net. They carefully stuffed the net with the dandelion fluff, making it as soft as, well, a cloud. Then, they used tough pine needles to stitch the big sycamore leaves all over the top, creating a beautiful, green, patchwork quilt.

It was magnificent, but it was also very heavy. It would take every single bat working together to lift it.

"Heave!" squeaked Pip. And with a mighty flapping of a thousand tiny wings, the bats lifted the giant blanket into the air. They flew in perfect formation, a dark, determined cloud carrying their soft, fluffy creation up, up, up into the brightening sky where the Moon was setting for his daytime sleep.

Very gently, so as not to wake him, they draped their masterpiece over the Moon’s sleeping face. His giant, craterous nose was now completely covered by the soft, green quilt.

A few minutes later, the playful clouds drifted by, ready for their morning tickle-session. They poked and prodded, but all they could tickle was the blanket. The Moon didn’t stir. He just snuggled a little deeper into his slumber and sighed a happy, peaceful sigh that sounded like the gentle rustling of all the leaves in the world.

The sneezes stopped. The forest below was finally quiet. The bats, tired but incredibly proud, flew back to their roosts for a well-deserved rest. Pip snuggled up next to his mother, and as he drifted off to sleep, he smiled, knowing that thanks to a team of tiny bats, the big, friendly Man in the Moon could finally get some rest.
